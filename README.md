### About Me
I’m a data and blockchain analyst with a passion for turning complex data into clear strategy — across both Web2 and Web3.

With a strong foundation in SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI  and Dune Analytics. I specialize in delivering actionable insights through analytics, financial modeling and data storytelling. From building forecasts in Excel to visualizing protocol metrics on-chain, I bridge the worlds of traditional finance and decentralized tech.

In Web2, I’ve supported teams with performance dashboards, pricing models, and operations reporting. 

In Web3, I’m focused on analyzing token economies, building dashboards on Dune, and helping founders make data-driven decisions in fast-moving ecosystems.

My financial modeling skills allow me to break down business mechanics whether it's projecting runway for a startup, modeling token emissions, or analyzing DeFi protocol revenues. I love blending structure with creativity to solve problems and inform strategy.

Right now, I’m exploring opportunities to work with startups, DAOs, or analytics teams that are building the future of finance and decentralization.
